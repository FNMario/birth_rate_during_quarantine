# Birth rate during quarantine in Argentina
This is a project to implement Data Extraction and Cleanup.\
I will analyze the available data to answer the following question:
### Did the birth rate increase during the quarantine in Argentina?
In order to answer this cuestion, I will use the [dataset of birth rates](notebooks/cleaning.ipynb) provided by the government of Argentina.\
I also will calculate the birthrates using a [birth dataset](notebooks/cleaning.ipynb), and some [population values](datasets/data_extraction.py) extracted from the web, with the objective of continuing to practice data handling and dataframes.
